\section{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:acknowledgements}
We would like to thank our two supervisors, Giovanni Bacci and Raphaël Reynouard for their guidance, supervision, and support throughout this project.

Giovanni provided valuable insights into the theoretical aspects of the \gls{bw} algorithm and its symbolic implementation, while Raphaël, the creator of \Jajapy, offered practical advice on integrating our work into the existing \Jajapy\ library and knowledge of the \gls{bw} algorithm.

Additionally, we would like to acknowledge that AI tools, ChatGPT and Grammarly were used to assist in the writing and editing of this paper.
ChatGPT was used in the phrasing of several paragraphs of text, and Grammarly has been used to proofread all the body text.
